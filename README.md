Machine Learning is a rapidly evolving field that is currently revolutionizing the way we interact with data. Machine learning course will start off with the basics, such as introducing the fundamentals of statistics and probability. From there, students will move on to more advanced topics like linear and logistic regression, classification, clustering, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the various models and techniques used in machine learning and be able to apply them to real-world problems.
